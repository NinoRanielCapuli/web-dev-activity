    <h2>Keeping Pets Healthy</h2>
    <p>
      Maintaining your pet’s health is one of the most important responsibilities 
      of ownership. From vaccinations and regular check-ups to daily care, every 
      effort you make contributes to a longer and happier life for your furry friend.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular vet visits help detect problems early, preventing them from becoming 
      more serious. Vaccinations protect pets from common and dangerous diseases, 
      while parasite control keeps them safe from ticks, fleas, and worms. Pay 
      attention to your pet’s appetite, energy, and bathroom habits—changes in 
      these areas can signal health concerns.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental health is also crucial. Pets need love, attention, and interaction 
      to stay emotionally well. Playtime, exercise, and companionship reduce stress 
      and prevent behavioral issues. With proper care and attention, your pets 
      will not only survive, but thrive.
