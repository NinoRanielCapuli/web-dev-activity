      <h2>Keeping Pets Healthy</h2>
      <p>Good health starts with regular veterinary visits. Puppies and kittens need a schedule of vaccinations to protect them from diseases like rabies, parvovirus, and distemper. Annual checkups are important for adults, while senior pets may require more frequent visits. Parasite prevention—such as flea, tick, and heartworm treatments—is also vital for long-term well-being.</p>
      <p>Be attentive to your pet’s behavior. Changes in appetite, energy, or bathroom habits may indicate illness. Common health concerns include obesity, dental disease, and skin allergies. Early detection and treatment can make a huge difference in recovery. Providing a balanced diet, regular exercise, and preventive care helps ensure your furry friend enjoys a long, healthy life.</p>
