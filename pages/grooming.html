    <h2>Why Grooming Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Grooming is more than just keeping your pet looking good‚Äîit plays a vital role in maintaining 
      their health and comfort. Regular baths, brushing, and nail trimming help prevent skin problems, 
      infections, and discomfort. Grooming also allows you to check for fleas, ticks, or any unusual 
      lumps on your pet‚Äôs body.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Different pets require different grooming routines. Dogs with thick coats may need daily brushing 
      to avoid matting, while short-haired breeds can be groomed less frequently. Cats often groom themselves, 
      but brushing helps reduce hairballs and keeps their coat shiny. Don‚Äôt forget to clean your pet‚Äôs ears 
      and brush their teeth regularly to avoid infections and dental problems.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from hygiene, grooming is a bonding activity. Taking time to brush your pet or trim their nails 
      gently shows love and care. When pets feel comfortable during grooming, they trust their owners more, 
      making it a positive experience for both of you.
