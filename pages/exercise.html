    <h2>Why Pets Need Exercise</h2>
    <p>
      Exercise is essential for every pet, no matter their size or breed. 
      Physical activity helps prevent obesity, strengthens muscles, and supports 
      cardiovascular health. Beyond the physical benefits, exercise also provides 
      mental stimulation, reducing stress and unwanted behaviors caused by boredom.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogs, for example, should be walked daily. Some breeds require longer runs, 
      while others are content with short walks and playtime. Cats may enjoy chasing 
      toys, climbing scratching posts, or exploring safe outdoor spaces. Even small 
      pets, such as rabbits or guinea pigs, benefit from play areas that encourage 
      movement and exploration.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular exercise also builds your bond with your pet. Playing fetch, running, 
      or practicing agility games makes pets more confident and happy. The key is 
      consistency: even 20‚Äì30 minutes daily can make a huge difference in your 
      pet‚Äôs life and longevity.
