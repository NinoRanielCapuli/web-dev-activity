      <h2>Exercise & Playtime</h2>
      <p>Exercise is critical to your pet’s physical and mental health. Dogs need daily walks and play sessions to burn energy and prevent behavioral issues. Active breeds may require extra activities such as agility training, running, or fetch games. Exercise not only strengthens muscles but also improves cardiovascular health and reduces stress.</p>
      <p>Cats also benefit from play. Interactive toys, climbing trees, and puzzle feeders keep them engaged and mimic natural hunting behaviors. Without enough activity, pets can become overweight or bored, leading to destructive habits. Regular exercise is more than physical—it builds stronger bonds between pets and their owners while keeping both sides happier and healthier.</p>
