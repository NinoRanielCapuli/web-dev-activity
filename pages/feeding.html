    <h2>Healthy Feeding Habits</h2>
    <p>
      Feeding your pet the right food is one of the most important responsibilities of ownership. 
      Just like humans, pets require a balanced diet that includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats, 
      vitamins, and minerals. Poor nutrition can lead to illnesses, weakness, and even shortened lifespans.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Always choose food appropriate for your pet‚Äôs age, size, and activity level. Puppies and kittens 
      need more protein to support rapid growth, while older pets may benefit from lower-calorie diets 
      to prevent obesity. Avoid giving human food that may be toxic, such as chocolate, onions, grapes, 
      and excessive salty snacks.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh water should always be available. If possible, feed your pets on a consistent schedule 
      to help regulate digestion and behavior. Treats can be used as rewards, but they should only 
      make up about 10% of your pet‚Äôs daily calorie intake. A good feeding routine ensures your 
      pet stays strong, happy, and full of energy every day.
