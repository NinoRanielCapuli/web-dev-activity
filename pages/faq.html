      <div class="faq-question">How often should I feed my dog?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Most adult dogs should be fed twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening. Puppies need more frequent meals, typically 3–4 times a day.</div>

      <div class="faq-question">How can I stop my cat from scratching furniture?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Provide scratching posts and pads around your home. Encourage use with catnip and rewards. Trim claws regularly to minimize damage.</div>

      <div class="faq-question">When should I take my pet to the vet?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">At least once a year for a check-up. Puppies, kittens, and senior pets may require more frequent visits.</div>

      <div class="faq-question">Can dogs eat human food?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Some human foods are safe, like plain chicken or rice, but many—such as chocolate, grapes, and onions—are toxic. Always research before sharing food.</div>
