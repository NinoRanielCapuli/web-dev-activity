    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Pet Care 101 was created to give Filipino pet owners a reliable and accessible 
      resource for pet care. We understand the challenges of raising pets, from 
      providing them with the right diet to ensuring they get proper healthcare, 
      training, and love. Our goal is to make pet parenting simpler by giving 
      practical advice that works in everyday life here in the Philippines.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a group of animal enthusiasts, trainers, and veterinary professionals 
      who believe pets deserve the best. Beyond just providing information, we aim 
      to build a community where pet owners can learn, share, and grow together. 
      Every article, guide, and tip is carefully crafted to help you become more 
      confident in raising your pets and making sure they are happy, healthy, and safe.
