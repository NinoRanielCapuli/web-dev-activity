      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Pet Care 101 was created with a simple mission: to provide pet owners with clear, practical, and 
        trustworthy information about raising healthy and happy pets. Too often, new pet owners feel 
        overwhelmed by the responsibilities of pet care. From feeding schedules to grooming routines, 
        it can feel like there is too much to learn. Our goal is to simplify the process and give you 
        the confidence to become a great pet parent.

      <p>
        We believe that pets are family members who deserve love, respect, and the best possible care. 
        That’s why our content is focused on everyday tips that are easy to follow and backed by reliable 
        sources. Whether you’re caring for a playful puppy, an energetic cat, or a senior pet with special 
        needs, Pet Care 101 has something for you. Together, let’s create a world where all pets live 
        healthier, happier lives.
