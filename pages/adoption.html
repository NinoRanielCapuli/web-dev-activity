    <h2>Why Adoption Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Adopting a pet is one of the most loving choices a person can make. 
      Every year, thousands of cats and dogs end up in shelters, waiting 
      for a family to welcome them home. By adopting, you are not only 
      giving a homeless pet a second chance, but also helping reduce the 
      problem of overpopulation.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelter pets come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. Some 
      are playful and energetic, while others are calm and affectionate. 
      Most have already been vaccinated and spayed or neutered, making 
      them ready for their forever home. Unlike buying from breeders or 
      pet shops, adoption fees are usually minimal and go toward supporting 
      the shelter.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Adoption also creates space for shelters to rescue more animals in 
      need. Every adoption is a victory not only for the pet but also for 
      the community. If you are ready for the responsibility, consider 
      visiting your local shelter‚Äîyou might just find your new best friend.
